This repository contains my submission for Task 02 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The goal of this task is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset and create visualizations to understand survival patterns among passengers.  
In this task, I explored the dataset using Python libraries and created various visualizations such as bar charts, count plots to examine how different factors like gender, age, class, and Embarkment influenced survival.

Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in:
- Cleaning and preprocessing real-world data  
- Handling missing values  
- Creating meaningful visualizations  
- Drawing conclusions based on observed trends

# Tools & Librabries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** 
- **NumPy** 
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** 
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Exploratory Data Analysis

###  Data Cleaning:
- Removed unnecessary columns like cabin.
- Filled missing `Age` values with mean ( because age is a continous numerical value ).
- Filled missing `Embarked` values with mode ( because embarked is a categorical values ).
- Converted `Age` into  age categories for better analysis.

 # Key Insights

- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers had better survival chances than those in 2nd or 3rd class.
- Males in 3rd class had the lowest survival rate.
- Young adults (18–30) had a lower survival rate compared to children.
- Most passengers boarded from Southampton.

# Summary
- This survival analysis reveals that survival on the Titanic was not random or purely based on chance—it was deeply affected by social structure and human decision-making. -The data highlights:
1. **The influence of gender roles**  
   Women and children were prioritized during evacuation, leading to higher survival rates among them.
2. **The impact of economic class**  
   First-class passengers had better access to lifeboats, significantly influencing survival chances.
3. **The role of age-based prioritization**  
   Younger passengers, especially children, were often given priority in rescue operations.
4. **The interaction of these factors**  
Gender, class, and age collectively determined who had a better chance of survival during the Titanic disaster.
Through this task i got to understand the real-world importance of data analysis in understanding human behavior, societal norms, and historical events and hence helped me to enhance my data visualization and understanding data more in dept.

Thank you for reviewing my work.
